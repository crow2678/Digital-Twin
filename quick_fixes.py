Provide a direct, personal response that:

2. Be specific and direct - no generic introductions
3. Combine all relevant information naturally
4. Use normal sentences, not bullet points
5. Don't explain what you're doing, just answer

Example good response: "You like butter chicken and tandoori pizza."
Example bad response: "Paresh appears to have interests in..."
