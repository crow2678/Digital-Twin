    Subject: Urgent: Data Migration Delays
    
    Hi,
    
    I'm writing to express concern about the delays in our data migration project. 
    We were expecting the initial phase to be completed by last Friday, but we haven't 
    received any updates.
    
    This delay is affecting our quarterly reporting and our board presentation is 
    next week. We need immediate clarification on:
    
    1. Current status of the migration
    2. Revised timeline with firm deadlines
    3. Compensation for the delays
    4. Steps to prevent future delays
    
    Please provide an update by end of day today.
    
    Best regards,
    Jennifer Smith
    CTO, BigCorp
