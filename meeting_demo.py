Team Planning Meeting - January 15, 2024
Attendees: Sarah (PM), Mike (Dev), Lisa (Design), Me

Sarah: Let's finalize our Q1 roadmap. We need to ship the new dashboard by March 15th.

Me: I can handle the API integration, but I'll need the database schema from Mike first.

Mike: I'll have the schema ready by February 1st. Also, we should consider performance testing.

Lisa: I'm working on the UI mockups. Should have initial designs by January 25th.

Sarah: Great. Mike, can you also set up the staging environment?

Mike: Yes, I'll get that done by February 5th.

Me: I'll need to coordinate with the QA team for testing. Should I schedule that now?

Sarah: Yes, please reach out to them this week. Also, we need to decide on the rollout strategy.

DECISIONS:
- Dashboard launch: March 15th
- Performance testing included
- QA team involvement confirmed

Client Requirements Meeting - TechCorp Project
Attendees: Jennifer (Client), Mark (Client Tech Lead), Me

Jennifer: We need the new system to handle 10,000 concurrent users by Q2.

Me: That's ambitious but doable. What's your current peak load?

Mark: Around 2,000 users, but we're expecting 5x growth after the marketing campaign.

Me: I'll need to review your infrastructure. Can you provide current server specs?

Jennifer: Mark can get you that by tomorrow. Also, what about data migration?

Me: For 10,000 users, we'll need a phased approach. I recommend starting with a pilot group.

Mark: Makes sense. How long for full migration?

Me: About 6-8 weeks for complete rollout, assuming no major technical blockers.

Jennifer: We need it done by April 30th for the board presentation.

NEXT STEPS:
- Mark to send server specs tomorrow
- Me to create migration timeline by Friday
- Schedule technical deep-dive next week

Vendor Evaluation - DataSoft Solutions
Attendees: Alex (Vendor Sales), Sarah (Vendor Tech), Me

Alex: Our platform can reduce your processing time by 60% and cut costs by 40%.

Me: That sounds impressive. What's the implementation timeline?

Sarah: Typically 8-12 weeks depending on data complexity and integration needs.

Me: We have some legacy systems. How do you handle data migration?

Sarah: We provide automated migration tools and dedicated support. Success rate is 99.2%.

Alex: We're offering a 20% discount if you sign by month-end, plus free training.

Me: I need to evaluate this against two other vendors. When do you need a decision?

Alex: We'd like an answer by February 15th to lock in Q1 pricing.

CONCERNS:
- No mention of data security certifications
- Pricing seems too good - what are the hidden costs?
- 8-12 week timeline might conflict with our Q2 deadline
